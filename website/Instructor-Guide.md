### Part 3: Setting up Connection in watsonx Orchestrate
We are doing this so that participants can directly connect to MCP server and tools, and they don't have to go through process of creating a MCP connection. For this we will first create connection details to Xero MCP server, and then connect to this server via a sample agent.

8. **Access watsonx Orchestrate**
   - Log into your IBM watsonx Orchestrate instance
   - Navigate to the **Connections** section from the main menu
   ![alt text](imgs/imgs_c/connections-tab.png)

9. **Create Xero Connection in WxO**
   - Click on **Add new Connection**
   ![alt text](imgs/imgs_c/add-new-connection.png)
   - Provide the details for the connection - connection name and description, and click save and continue
   ![alt text](imgs/imgs_c/conection-details.png)
   - Select authentication type as key value pair, and team credentials
   ![alt text](imgs/imgs_c/draft-env-kv-pair-team.png)
   - Provide the required values in the key-value as client id and client secret that you got earliers, click connect and then next
   ![alt text](imgs/imgs_c/provide-values-click-connect.png)
   - In the next screen, repeat the process for the live environment. The one you did earlier was for draft environment

## Next Steps
In this guide, we have configured the xero connections in our wxo environment, and users in the following labs can directly search for tools from the MCP server for their use.
