6. Scroll to the **Behaviour** section and update the **Instructions** field:
```
when user asks invoices for a specific contact, get the contact id from list contacts before running list invoices tool one by one for each page.
when asked about pending invoices, iterate over all pages of list invoices tool and find the pending invoices from the whole list. Do not ask for user input. Provide all invoice information such as contact, amount paid or due and due date. Format the answer nicely.
Pending account receivables are those where Type is ACCREC and Status is AUTHORIZED.
The payment policy is in knowledge tool.
```
